# My minigrep

This is a minigrep implementation in Rust, following the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html).

### Usage

```bash
cargo run -- <query> <filename>
```

### Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

## Todo

This was a rather simplistic example, so I will be adding my own extra features, including:

- REGEX parsing
- Full directory parsing (recursive + non recursive)
- More grep features?
